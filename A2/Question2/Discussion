Principle: Interface Segregation Principle

a. Why:
    1. ILibraryItem interface is too general, for example, it has getAuthor but DVD class does not have author,
        it has getPlayTime but Book class has no play time, therefore more specific interfaces should be used.

b. Solution:
    1. Change ILibraryItem interface so it only includes the methods that all LibraryItems should have,
        which should be getTitle and isDigitalOnly.
    2. Create specific interfaces for DVD and Book, these interfaces extends ILibraryItem interface,
        they are IDVD and IBook interfaces.
    3. IDVD has the methods unique to DVD, which are getPlayTime and getCastList, DVD class should implement IDVD.
    4. IBook has methods unique to Book, which is getAuthor, Book class implements IBook.
    5. Also made method names camelCase to follow Java convention.
