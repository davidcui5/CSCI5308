Principle: Single Responsibility Principle

a. Why:
    1. Each class should have single responsibility, ProfitReport class however has 3 responsibilities right now,
        which are ProfitReport, SendToPrinter, and SendToEmail.
    2. SendToPrinter and SendToEmail should not be responsibility of ProfitReport class.

b. Solution:
    1. Have 3 classes, ProfitReport, EmailSender, PrintJobSender.
    2. ProfitReport has reportData, createReport, getReportData.
    3. EmailSender has sendEmail(String emailAddress, String subject, ArrayList<String> reportData),
        which sends reportData in an email.
    4. PrintJobSender has sendPrintJob(ArrayList<String> reportData), which sends reportData to printer.
    5. More specifically, I did these things so each class has single responsibility:
        a. Removed SendToEmail and SendToPrinter in ProfitReport class.
        b. Added a getReportData method in ProfitReport to allow other classes to access reportData.
        c. Changed EmailSender class, so its sendEmail method now takes in reportData, formats it, and send it as email.
        d. Added a PrintJobSender class which has sendPrintJob method that takes reportData as input, format the data
            and send print job to printer.
    6. Now, ProfitReport class only does ProfitReport things, EmailSender does email sending, and PrintJobSender does
        print job sending.
