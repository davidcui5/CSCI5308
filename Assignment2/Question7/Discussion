Principle: Interface Segregation Principle
a. Why:
    i. IInsect interface is too general, it has swim() and fly() methods but not all insects can swim and fly, more specific interfaces should be used.
b. Solution:
    i. Change IInsect so it only has MoveAntennae() because MoveAntennae is common to all insects.
    ii. Create ISwimmable interface which extends IInsect and has swim() method, let AquaticInsect implements ISwimmable, and remove fly().
    iii. Create IFlyable interface which extends IInsect and has fly() method, let FlyingInsect implements IFlyable, and remove swim().
    iv. This means we have swimmable and flyable insects.
